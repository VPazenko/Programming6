The assignment is a pipeline for training two models (RF and SVM) and selecting the model with the highest accuracy (model parameters will be recorded in the final report).

The current repository contains an example of the final report and pre-trained models. 

Usage:
- unzip the initial data (archive with data can be obtained from the repository owner)
- delete the 'results' folder
- run the file: ./workflow/run.sh
